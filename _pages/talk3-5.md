    <h3>Biography</h3>
    <p>
Dr. Zhifeng Hao has devoted himself to the research on major fundamental theories including the research of Morita Theory of algebra and the Theory's application in Hopf algebras. Being rigorous in his scholarship, tireless, and assiduous, Dr. Hao dives into science and technology and constantly makes progress and achievements. He has successively presided over more than 20 projects such as major breakthrough bidding projects in key fields including the National Natural Science Foundation of China, the "Program for New Century Excellent Talents", Fok Ying Tung Education Foundation (FYTEF) of the Ministry of Education, the Outstanding Young Teachers Fund of the Ministry of Education, the provincial and ministerial industry-university-research major projects, the Guangdong-Hong Kong major breakthrough bidding projects, as well as the Guangdong Provincial Fund Project, the Guangdong Provincial Science and Technology Research Project, the Guangdong Provincial Soft Science Project and Guangzhou Municipal Soft Science project. He has achieved a series of important research results with his own characteristics, and many of the results are obtained or confirmed for the first time in the world. He is a young academic leader in domestic research in this field, has strong scientific research ability, and has good scientific morality. Dr. Hao thoroughly solved a famous open problem raised by the algebra community in the early 1970s, constructing a Hopf algebraic structure theorem in a unique way, and he also answered an open question about the order of the antipode by an internationally renowned algebra expert, Professor E.J.Taft, attracting the attention of the algebraic circles at home and abroad. It is the first time in the world to use the external method of comodule to describe the coreflexive coalgebras and obtain the discriminant theorem of coreflexive coalgebras and the construction method of the coalgebra Ko group.

Dr. Hao has won so many prizes, including the second prize in the National Natural Science Award of the Ministry of Education, the second prize in the Guangdong Provincial Science and Technology Progress Award, the second prize in the 6th Fok Ying Tung Education Foundation (FYTEF) of State Education Commission of the PRC awards to select young lecturers from higher education institutions (HEIs) in recognition of their outstanding performance in scientific research and teaching, the second prize in the Guangdong Natural Science Excellent Paper Award, the second prize in the Guangzhou Association for Science and Technology Excellent Paper Award, the second prize in National Excellent Teaching Achievement Award, the first prize in Guangdong Provincial Excellent Teaching Achievement Award twice (2001, 2005), and won the Ding Ying Science and Technology Award of Guangdong Province in 2007. What's more, he has been selected for the Program for New Century Excellent Talents of the Ministry of Education and the "Thousand-Hundred-Ten" Program of Guangdong Province at a provincial level and has won the title of "Nanyue Excellent Teacher" of Guangdong province. Dr. Hao is also a member of the Mathematics and Statistics Teaching Guidance Sub-Committee of the Ministry of Education, a member of the CUMCM (China Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling), a director of the Chinese Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics, a member of the Standing Committee of the Guangzhou Association for Science and Technology, and the council chairman of the Guangzhou Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics.
